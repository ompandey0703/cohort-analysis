  Here’s a step-by-step plan for expanding your module, with the recommended order of changes and some feature suggestions:

1. Design/Planning
List all new user inputs and features you want to support (SQL upload, DB URL, table selection, advanced preprocessing, chart selection, etc.).
Decide on the user flow: Will users upload a file, paste SQL, or connect to a DB? What’s the default path?
2. Frontend: Update Data Models and Context
Update AnalysisData and related types to support new sources (file, SQL, DB URL), table name, preprocessing config, and chart options.
Update context/provider to store and manage these new fields.
3. Frontend: UI/UX Changes
Add input fields for:
SQL file upload or SQL query textarea.
Postgres DB URL input.
Table selection dropdown (populated after DB connect).
Advanced preprocessing options (with sensible defaults and sub-options for null handling, etc.).
Chart type dropdown (retention, bar, line, pie, etc.).
Add logic to show/hide relevant fields based on user’s data source selection.
Add validation and helpful tooltips for complex options.
4. Backend: API & Model Changes
Update backend models (AnalysisRequest, etc.) to accept new fields: data source type, SQL, DB URL, table name, preprocessing config, chart type.
Update backend logic to:
Connect to Postgres using provided URL and fetch table list.
Run analysis on selected table or SQL query.
Handle advanced preprocessing options (categorical/numerical imputation, etc.).
Generate different chart types based on user selection.
Add endpoints for:
Fetching table list from DB.
Previewing table data/columns.
Running analysis with new options.
5. Frontend: Integrate with Backend
Update API calls to send new fields.
Handle new responses (e.g., chart images, table previews, etc.).
Display new chart types using dropdown selection.
Show preprocessing options dynamically based on user choices.
6. Testing & UX Polish
Test all flows: file upload, SQL, DB URL, table selection, preprocessing, chart selection.
Add error handling for DB connection issues, SQL errors, etc.
Polish UI for clarity and ease of use.
7. Feature Suggestions for More Usefulness
Data preview: Show a sample of the data/table before running analysis.
Save/load analysis configs: Let users save their settings for future runs.
Export results: Allow users to download charts, tables, and insights as images or CSV/PDF.
Scheduled analysis: Let users schedule recurring analyses on a DB.
User authentication: For multi-user environments, add login and save user-specific configs/history.
Custom SQL: Allow users to write custom SQL for more advanced use cases.
Interactive charts: Enable drill-down or filtering on charts.
Explainability: Add tooltips or explanations for each metric and chart.
Order of changes:

Plan features and user flow
Update frontend data models/context
Update frontend UI for new inputs
Update backend models and endpoints
Integrate frontend with backend
Test and polish
Add advanced features as needed
This approach ensures smooth incremental development and a robust, user-friendly tool.

1. Frontend: Update Data Models & Context
Update AnalysisData and related types to include:
dataSourceType (csv, sql, db)
dbUrl (if db selected)
sqlFile or sqlQuery (if sql selected)
selectedTable (if db selected)
Advanced preprocessing options (object for null handling, imputation, etc.)
chartType (dropdown for retention, ARPU, LTV, etc.)
2. Frontend: UI/UX
Add a dropdown for data source selection (CSV, SQL file, DB URL).
Conditionally show:
File upload for CSV/SQL.
DB URL input and table dropdown for DB.
Add advanced preprocessing options (null handling, imputation, etc.) with sensible defaults and sub-options.
Add chart type dropdown (retention, ARPU, LTV, etc.) for revenue analysis.
Add tooltips/help for advanced options.
3. Backend: Models & Endpoints
Update backend request models to accept:
Data source type, DB URL, SQL, table name, preprocessing config, chart type.
Update backend logic to:
Handle DB connection and table fetching.
Parse and run SQL if provided.
Apply advanced preprocessing as per user config.
Generate different chart types as requested.
Add endpoints for:
Fetching table list from DB.
Previewing table data/columns.
4. Frontend: API Integration
Update API calls to send new fields.
Handle new responses (e.g., multiple chart images, table previews).
Display selected chart type based on dropdown.
5. Testing & UX Polish
Test all flows: file upload, SQL, DB, table selection, preprocessing, chart selection.
Add error handling for DB/SQL issues.
Polish UI for clarity.
6. (Optional) Feature Suggestions
Data/table preview before analysis.
Save/load analysis configs.
Export results (CSV, PDF, image).
Scheduled analysis.
User authentication.
Custom SQL editor.
Interactive charts.
Explainability tooltips.
Summary:
Start with data model/context changes, then UI, then backend, then API integration, then polish and test.
This will keep your development smooth and modular!

Here I am removing sqlFile and chartype field as upload functionality is handled by backend so we will save sqlfile there and chartype field is already handled by analysis_metric (just give me a note what i need to handle at backend )

Note for Backend Changes:

Since the frontend will no longer send sqlFile and chartType:
The backend should handle SQL file uploads and storage internally, associating the uploaded file with the user's session or request.
For chart type, use the analysis_metric field to determine which chart(s) to generate and return, instead of relying on a separate chartType field.
